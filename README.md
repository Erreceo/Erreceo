### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I am Rodrigo :) 

I started to work with technology because I believe that by building new things I can make the world a better place to live.

I have been working as a software engineer for the last twelve years, with the most part of experience working on banking as a service and lending products. With strong knowledge and experience in Java (12 years of experience), I also have abilities to work with JavaScript and their frameworks: React, Redux, NodeJs, NextJs, React Native (4 years of experience) and with other languages too, such as Python and Go. In databases, I have worked with SQL Server, Oracle, DB2, MySQL, Postgres, MongoDb and SQLite.

Learning new things and reading are my favorite things.
